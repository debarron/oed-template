This repository is a file structure to organize the data from an
experiment intensive research.
For every experiment you need to generate, copy the experiment directory.
Make sure to generate a description file for each experiment, where you
describe how data needs to be interpreted.

As for the rest, every experiment (in my view), shares a directory to
place raw data, averages (avg) from the raw data, scripts to process
the information and imgs. 

In my case, imgs are the ultimate goal, so the scripts output end up
as a image file, generated from a gnu or a shell scipt, or both.
